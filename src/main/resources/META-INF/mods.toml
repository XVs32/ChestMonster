description='''
This mod could sort your chest or inventory by pressing one single key, the idea comes from a famous mod "Inventory Tweaks", which unfortunately is unmaintained at the moment.
Note that this mod is still in progress and currently have way less functions than the original "Inventory Tweaks". I might or might not update this mod due to the time I have, and the fact that I'm a C programmer and this my first ever JAVA project.
