# Readme - ChestMonster

---

## What is this mod all about?

* This mod sort your ***inventory*** or ***chest*** by simply pressing one key.

* This is a Server-Client mod, which means it needs to install on both ***client*** and ***server*** side.

The idea comes from an amazing mod "Inventory Tweaks", which unfortunately is unmaintained at the moment.

Note that this mod is still in progress and currently have way fewer functions than the original "Inventory Tweaks".
